**Introduction to the Idea**

Giggles is an innovative online marketplace where people can buy and sell preloved toys at excellent value. The idea behind Giggles is to address the problems of wastage, boredom, and increasing prices of toys. The world is full of problems, from poverty, wars, racism, sexism, income inequality, and social disparity, and while we can't solve everything, we can work towards reducing waste and curbing the increasing prices of new toys. With Giggles, we aim to build a better planet for future generations by creating the best online kids thrift store with thousands of items on consignment for babies and kids, thus preventing toys from becoming waste.

The Indian Toy Industry is enormous, with the large market size being the primary reason for its growth. However, the industry's rapid expansion has also led to a rise in waste. Over two billion tonnes of waste are sent to landfills by households annually, and the way we dispose of things we once loved is of utmost importance. Giggles aims to reduce clutter and curtail waste through circularity, or the reuse and sharing model. The circular economy model is the future we must embrace, and Giggles intends to mainstream this model for toys.

Giggles offers a solution to the problem of increasing prices of toys by providing a platform for people to buy and sell preloved toys at excellent value. The platform also addresses the problem of boredom by offering a wide range of toys for children to play with. By reselling used toys, Giggles reduces the number of toys sent to landfills, thereby contributing to a cleaner environment.

The primary goal is to build a better planet for future generations by creating the best online kids thrift store with thousands of items on consignment for babies and kids, thus preventing toys from becoming waste. The Giggles team understands that selling preloved toys may not be everyone's cup of tea, and that's why they aim to make the process as easy as possible. The seller doesn't have to do anything; they just have to sit back, relax, and let Giggles do the work.

The Giggles app is user-friendly and easy to navigate. The toys are divided into various categories to enable circularity like never before. Giggles offers a wide range of preloved toys for babies and kids, from strollers, cribs, prams, teddy bears, tricycles, and more. The platform offers educational toys, which usually come at a premium cost, at an affordable price, allowing parents to save money and reduce waste. The platform's focus on education and affordability bridges the early childhood capitalism and economic divide created by toys.

In conclusion, Giggles is an innovative online marketplace that offers a solution to the problem of waste, boredom, and increasing prices of toys. The platform's focus on circularity and affordability bridges the gap between early childhood capitalism and the economic divide created by toys. Giggles aims to build a better planet for future generations by creating the best online kids thrift store with thousands of items on consignment for babies and kids, thus preventing toys from becoming waste. The platform is user-friendly and easy to navigate, making the process of buying and selling preloved toys as easy as possible.

**A NARRATIVE REPORT**

**Introduction**

Giggles is a social business idea that aims to solve several issues at once, including waste reduction, increasing prices, and bridging the economic divide created by toys. The idea is centered around creating an online marketplace for preloved toys, where people can sell their unused toys at excellent value, and buyers can purchase high-quality toys at affordable prices.

**The Concept**

The concept of Giggles emerged from a realization that the world has many problems, including social disparity, racism, income inequality, and poverty. While Giggles cannot solve all of these problems, it can address a few issues such as waste reduction, increasing prices, and bridging the economic divide created by toys.

The Indian Toy Industry is enormous, and the large market size is the primary reason for its success. However, in recent years, we have witnessed a significant increase in the number of toys being sent to landfills, causing harm to the environment. Giggles aims to address this problem by encouraging the reuse of preloved toys, thereby curbing wastage and reducing environmental harm.

**Market Analysis**

To understand the market for Giggles, we conducted a field study and analyzed existing startups in the US and France. Our study found that there is a significant demand for preloved toys among parents who are looking for high-quality toys at affordable prices. Additionally, many parents are concerned about the environment and would prefer to buy preloved toys to reduce waste.

We also analyzed the existing startups in the US and France and found that the circular economy model for toys is a highly successful and sustainable business model. One such startup, Rejuoe, has been reselling used toys since 2012 and has saved over 300 tonnes of toys from landfills.

**Solution**

Giggles' solution is to create an online marketplace for preloved toys that will enable parents to buy high-quality toys at affordable prices and prevent toys from becoming waste. The platform will be user-friendly, with a minimalist theme and a user-friendly UI, allowing users to easily navigate through the app.

To address the pitfalls of existing platforms such as Olx, Giggles aims to simplify the process of selling preloved toys. The seller has to do practically nothing other than upload images and provide a brief description of the toy. The platform takes care of the rest, including pricing, marketing, and shipping.

Giggles also aims to address the economic divide created by toys by providing affordable access to high-quality toys to parents across all socio-economic backgrounds. This will enable parents to provide their children with a range of toys that will aid their cognitive development and overall growth.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, Giggles is a unique social business idea that aims to address several pressing issues, including waste reduction, increasing prices, and bridging the economic divide created by toys. The platform offers a sustainable and affordable solution that benefits the environment, parents, and children alike. With its user-friendly UI and minimalistic design, Giggles has the potential to become a leading player in the circular economy model for toys.

**Different Phases of the Startup**

The start-up phase of Giggles would entail creating a solid foundation for the business, including registering the company, developing a business plan, conducting market research, creating a website and mobile application, and designing a marketing strategy. The company would need to identify its target audience and understand their needs and preferences to provide them with the best possible service. The team would also need to establish partnerships with toy manufacturers and suppliers to ensure a steady supply of pre-loved toys.

Once the groundwork is laid, the subsequent phases of Giggles would involve launching the website and mobile application, creating awareness about the brand and its mission through social media marketing and other promotional activities. The team would also need to build a network of sellers who would list their unused toys on the platform, ensuring a wide range of options for buyers. During the initial months, the team would need to monitor the platform's performance, collect feedback from users, and make necessary adjustments to improve the user experience. Giggles would also need to establish a secure and reliable payment system to facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers.

By the end of year one, Giggles should have a significant user base, consisting of both buyers and sellers. The company should have established its brand identity and reputation as a reliable and eco-friendly marketplace for pre-loved toys. The team would need to continue working on expanding the product range, adding more features to the platform, and improving its marketing strategies to attract new users.

By the end of year two, Giggles should have established itself as a dominant player in the Indian toy market. The platform should have a vast selection of pre-loved toys, and the company should have partnerships with multiple toy manufacturers and suppliers. Giggles would also need to consider expanding its operations to other regions in India and beyond, depending on the success of the business. The team should continue working on improving the platform's features, user experience, and marketing strategies to maintain its competitive edge in the market.
